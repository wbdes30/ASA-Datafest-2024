# ASA Datafest 2024 Challenge
CourseKata is a platform that creates and publishes a series of e-books for introductory statistics and data science classes that utilize demonstrated learning strategies to help students learn statistics and data science.  The developers of CourseKata, Jim Stigler (UCLA) and Ji Son (Cal State Los Angeles) and their team, are cognitive psychologists interested in improving statistics learning  by examining students' interactions with online interactive textbooks. Traditionally, much of the research on how students learn is done in a 1-hour lab or through small-scale student interviews.  CourseKata offers the opportunity to peek into thousands of students' actions, responses, and choices as they are engaged in learning the interrelated concepts and skills of statistics and coding in R over many weeks or months in real classes. 

Our challenge is to examine the data and make suggestions to help CourseKata improve the student experience of learning statistics.
