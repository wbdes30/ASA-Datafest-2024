# ASA Datafest 2024 Challenge
CourseKata is a platform that creates and publishes a series of e-books for introductory statistics and data science classes that utilize demonstrated learning strategies to help students learn statistics and data science.  The developers of CourseKata, Jim Stigler (UCLA) and Ji Son (Cal State Los Angeles) and their team, are cognitive psychologists interested in improving statistics learning  by examining students' interactions with online interactive textbooks. Traditionally, much of the research in how students learn is done in a 1-hour lab or through small-scale interviews with students.  CourseKata offers the opportunity to peek into the actions, responses, and choices of thousands of students as they are engaged in learning the interrelated concepts and skills of statistics and coding in R over many weeks or months in real classes. 

Your challenge is to examine the data and make suggestions to help CourseKata improve the student experience of learning statistics. Your suggestions might be directed to the CourseKata team, and include observations about patterns of engagement, stumbling points, clear successes, missing features, etc.  Or they might be directed to students or their classroom instructors and suggest learning strategies that the data signal are underutilized (or are particularly successful).
